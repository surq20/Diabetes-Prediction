Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia, in turn, is caused by defective insulin secretion or impairment of its biological action, or both. The chronic presence of hyperglycemia leads to chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, especially the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. Learning how to use machine learning to predict diabetes can help us detect it as soon as possible and treat it as early as possible. Machine learning analyzes the degree of influence of each value in a given dataset, and uses a suitable method to model and analyze and predict, as a function of diabetes prediction. The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle, and the dataset was subjected to data analysis and data processing to analyze which factors have a greater impact, perform feature selection, and later focus on analysis. The two machine learning methods used in this project are random forest and support vector machine, and the F1-Score, accuracy and recall after comparing the two modeling analysis to draw the optimal conclusion.
